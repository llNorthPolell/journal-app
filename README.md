# About
This branch is a microservice implementation of the server for the Journal App. However, it was scrapped due to the complications with cost and finding the right cloud providers. After careful consideration, it appears to be more efficient to host the server on a free provider like Render as this project is still rather small. This branch was left here for when it is time to convert this project into a microservice, or to show what it might look like if this app uses microservices.
