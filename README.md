# journal-app
Journal app built using React and Firebase. Note Firebase is being used to prototype the frontend application features. I am currently working on writing a Java Spring Boot backend to replace Firebase. 
App can be accessed via https://journal-app-75df1.firebaseapp.com.


# Why use Journal App?
Do you live with piles of books scattered across the room? Tired of scrolling through Excel pages to write down progress for the day? Do you wish you can "ctrl-z" and "ctrl-F" in real life? Journal App (don't have a name yet) can solve all of these problems. Journal App provides users with an intuitive UI to help them with journal-keeping tasks. Journal App is suitable for things like practice journals, personal project logs, research journals, and more, as it will provide users with a variety of dashboard widgets like graphs, charts, small scrum boards, or scribbleboards.
